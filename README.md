## Calculator (pronounced kal-kyoo-lator)
A simple calculator built with Python using ttkbootstrap for a modern look. Some some crusty musty dusty default tkinter one augh.
(Also featuring a silly "have a stroke" button for fun. Why not?)

## Features
Basic Operations: Add, subtract, multiply, divide, modulo, and decimal support.

Responsive Design: Layout scales with window size.

Keyboard Support: You can type numbers and press Enter to calculate!

Clear and Backspace Buttons: Easily fix mistakes or reset.

Colorful "Stroke" Mode: Activate a chaotic color mode across the app (because why not?).

## Requirements
Python 3.7+

ttkbootstrap

Install it with:

`bash`
`Copy`
`Edit`
`pip install ttkbootstrap`

## How to Run the british program
Clone this repository or download the code, obviously.

Run the script:

`bash`
`Copy`
`Edit`
`python calculator.py`
## Controls

Action	How to Do It
Type numbers and symbols	Use your keyboard!
Calculate result	Press = button or Enter key
Clear all	Press the C button
Backspace last character	Press the backspace button
Chaos mode	Press the Have a stroke button
## Notes
The "Have a stroke" button randomly changes all widget colors very fast. So if you have epilepsy, tough luck.

The calculator uses eval() internally â€” use trusted input only if modifying.
I dont care lmao aaaaaaaaaa

## Preview
You really thought i would add a preview?

## Future Improvements (optional ideas)
Add parentheses support

Add light/dark mode switching

Improve error handling (like showing "Error" instead of crashing on invalid input)

## Credits
Made without Andre and with Python... maybe... hehe...
